        - Does Redshift have Row-Level Security policies?
        - Are there per-tenant resource quotas?
        - Are queries validated before execution?

    - [ ] I know to focus on trust boundary crossings FIRST
    - [ ] I understand that Processes can have ALL STRIDE threats
    - [ ] I know to ask threat questions systematically for each element
    
    **Ready to Proceed:**
    - [ ] I'm confident I can identify WHERE threats occur
